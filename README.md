# Technologies I used for _Blackjack_.
1. I used HTML for the text, inputs, and buttons.
2. I used CSS to style my project, add colors, text size, box sizes, and to render all the cards in the deck.
3. I used CSS Card Library to render the deck of card.
4. I used JavaScript to assign tasks and to assign logic to the game.
